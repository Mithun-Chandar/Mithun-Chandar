# A Big Hello to everyone reading this.
***Here is something personal about me:***

My name is **Mithun** from India, specifically from a city called Chennai in souther India. 
I'm currently a **3rd year Computer Science** student at **Vistula University**, Warsaw, Poland.
Its been already been a year since I arrived to warsaw. This alienated city is no more alien for me, I'm getting accustomed to Warsaw day by day.
Starting from the friends I gathered here to the ones who I call my Warsaw family. And sadly none of them are from my university since its been closed for all the time I've been here.

**Professional Stuffs:**

The basics of C++ which I learnt during my highschool laid the foundation to make me persue a career in Computer Science and started to learn more concepts on my own.
Felt python is quite easy to code but as it went on the indents started to piss me off till now. But still  I quite enjoy to code particularly if its something challenging and complex.

**Current Goal:**

Master the basics of Data Structures and Algorithms and move on to cloud computing.








If you read the entire documentation ping me up :shipit:
